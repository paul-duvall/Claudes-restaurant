# Claudes-restaurant

This project is a brochure website for a fictional restaurant called Claude's.

It uses jQuery to add responsive elements, including subtle animation of text on load and the responsive burger-style menu for smaller viewports.

Site will ultimately have several subpages, which will include:

- menu pages, which will allow me to practice layout and fine points of design that I'd like to practice using css properties such as letter-spacing, line-spacing, font-weight, etc.

- a reservations page, for which I will need to integrate a form and potentially a calendar

- a news page, for which I will need to replicate a blog-style layout, hopefully generated using javascript template literals

I hope to include a couple of sub-sections, which will allow me to impliment a dropdown from the main menu.
